# ppo.cpp
This repository implements PPO for continuous action spaces in C++ matching the [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) python implementation closely. It also contains a [minimum port](libs/gymcpp) of [gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) to C++, containing the needed functionality for PPO.
Additionally, the repository provides environments for mujoco, [half_cheetah_v5](libs/gymcpp/mujoco/half_cheetah_v5.h) and [humanoid_v4](libs/gymcpp/mujoco/humanoid_v4.h), as well as an environment for autonomous driving with the CARLA leaderboard 2.0.

The repository also implements Asynchronous Collection Proximal Policy Optimization (AC-PPO) which parallelized data collection via multithreading and cuda streams, leading to faster training time than PPO in nonhomogeneous environments.
The idea is described in Appendix B.1 of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17838).

To run the training and evaluation of with the CARLA leaderboard 2.0, you also need to download and set up the [CaRL repo](https://github.com/autonomousvision/CaRL).

## Setup
To most convenient way to compile and run the program is to build the singularity container and run the code inside that.
Building the container can take a while, depending on your CPU power, because it builds several libraries and needs 12 GB of space. I have tested the code with singularity-ce version 3.11, but other version should work as well.
```Shell
cd tools
sudo singularity build ppo_cpp.sif make_singularity_image.def
```
Alternatively you can setup your own computer by installing all necessary libaries. You can have a look at [make_singularity_image.def](tools/make_singularity_image.def) on how to do it.
This often takes some time and you will face various issues, so it is only recommended for experienced C++ users.

The container is currently not compatible for the Mujoco code. Some libaries are missing and the use of 
`<format>` in the file needs to be changed to `<boost/format>` because the ubuntu 22 gcc version in the compiler does not support `<format>` yet.


## Compiling
The code can be compiled via cmake:
```Shell
singularity exec ppo_cpp.sif cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Ninja" ..
singularity exec ppo_cpp.sif cmake --build build -j20
```
By default, the cmake script compiles both the Mujoco and CARLA code. 
The mujoco code is currently commented in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) because the container doesn't support it yet.

## Training models
To use multipled GPUs for training the code needs to be started with mpirun (`-n` = number of GPUs), similar how pytorch DDP ist started with torchrun:
```Shell
mpirun -n 1 --bind-to none /path/to/ppo_cpp --exp_name_stem Test_AC_PPO_000 --env_id HalfCheetah-v5 --seed 500
```
To train CARLA models have a look at the training scripts in [CaRL](https://github.com/autonomousvision/CaRL/blob/main/CARLA/team_code/train_carl_cpp.sh).  
Generally you need to build the container, compile the program and then set the paths correctly: 
```Shell
--ppo_cpp_install_path /path/to/folder_with_binaries
--cpp_singularity_file_path /path/to/ppo_cpp.sif
```
